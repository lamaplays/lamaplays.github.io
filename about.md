# About Me


Hi, welcome here

I'm Lama, I like to build software and AI pipelines. I'm a huge advocate for life-long learning so I'm constantly seeking opportunities to develop my skills and learn.
i did a BSc in computer science. I'm a curious soul and I aspire to be come a researcher in my field.

here are my projects:
- [medPic- medicine recognition + RAG (my senior year project)](https://github.com/lamaplays/medPic)
- [a simple discord bot](https://github.com/lamaplays/K-2SO) 
- [developed a bunch of game mvps](insert link to screenshots)

what I'm doing next: 
- local AI agent
- dark pink theme chrome extension 
- - - 

fun fact: this page was written and pushed to GitHub pages through obsidian!
